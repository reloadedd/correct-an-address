## Requirements
- Write an algorithm that corrects the fields country, state, city of a postal address. Example: 
```
Country: RO, State: New York, City: Iasi
```
will become
```
Country: RO, State: Iasi, City: Iasi
```
- The algorithm needs to have unit tests and integration tests for performance and precision
- Ideally the algorithm will work for all countries in the world and a few languages
- Expose a REST API using Spring Boot that will receive a postal address and return the corrected result
- Deploy the application as a Docker container in AWS/Heroku or other using a continuous deployment pipeline
